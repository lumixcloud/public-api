# LumixCloud. API Documentation. English version.

#### To get started with our API, you must connect to the `interaction point` :

1. Api.LumixCloud.Net
(Addresses may be edit)

With this address, `all` further work with the `API occurs`. 
For example, to check the token for operability, you can use the Get Request at the address: 

api.lumixcloud.net/token/(Here is your token)

You will receive a json response of the form: {token: "xxx", expire_time: "05/10/2020 18:20:16"}
#### In the process of your interaction, various kinds of `errors` can occur, you can read about them [here](https://soon/).
#### For ease of development, we advise you to install the extension for the Chrome browser: [JSON FORMATTER](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa). It translates json in a readable form.
